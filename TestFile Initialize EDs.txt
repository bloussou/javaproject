*Probability laws available to generate a timelaps before a new arrival : 
*	- UNIFORM(X,Y) : Uniform law where X is the minimum arrival time(minutes) and Y the maximum arrivalTime (!!startTime==UNIFORM[0]!!)
*	- EXP(L) : Exponential law where L is the exp parameter (E[x] = 1/L , V[x] = 1/L)
* 	- LOGNORM(U,S) : LogNormal law attached to an alea variable X~log(N(u,s)) ( E[x]=exp(u+s²/2), V[x]=(exp(s²)-1)*exp(2u+s²) )  
*	- GAMMA(K,T) : Gamma law ( E[x]=K*T, V[x]=K*T² )
