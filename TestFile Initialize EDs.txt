*Probability laws available to generate a timelaps before a new arrival : 
*	- UNIFORM(X,Y) : Uniform law where X is the minimum time(minutes) before new arrival and Y the maximum
*	- EXP(L) : Exponential law where L is the parameter 
* 	- LOGNORM(U,S) : LogNormal law where u is the esperance, and S is the variance
*	- GAMMA(K,T) : 
Patients L1 - arriving until Time=10min, arrivals probability distribution : UNIFORM(2,5)
Patients L2 - arriving until Time=10min, arrivals probability distribution : EXP(5)
Patients L3 - arriving until Time=10min, arrivals probability distribution : LOGNORM(2,3)
Patients L4 - arriving until Time=10min, arrivals probability distribution : GAMMA(1,2)
Patients L5 - arriving until Time=10min, arrivals probability distribution : UNIFORM(1,3)
